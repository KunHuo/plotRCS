#' Location of knots from Harrell (2001), Regression Modeling Strategies.
#'
#' @param k number of knots, must be strictly between 3 and 7.
#'
#' @details
#' Harrell (2001) states that for many datasets, k = 4 offers an adequate fit of
#' the model and is a good compromise between flexibility and loss of pocesion
#' caused by overfitting a small sample‚Äù. If the sample size is small, three knots
#' should be used in order to have enough observations in between the knots to be
#' able to fit each polynomial. If the sample size is large and if there is reason
#' to believe that the relationship being studied changes quickly, more than five
#' knots can be used.
